Files overview
vending-machine.ts          VendingMachine production code
vending-machine.test.ts     automatic tests for VendingMachine
vending-machine-printer.ts  PRINTER used for approval testing VendingMachine

1. One of the unit tests are failing because of a bug. Fix the bug to go green!
2. Add one approval test for each unit test, rewriting them to approval style.
   The PRINTER in VendingMachinePrinter is incomplete, so you will have to extend
   it.
3. How readable can you make the text representation of the VendingMachine state?
   Try to really improve the print-out from the PRINTER making is super clear!
