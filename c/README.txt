Vending Machine - designing an approval printer
-----------------------------------------------

We'll play around with a central concept of
Approval Testing: the printer.

The printer is responsible for converting the
object-structure-datatype we are interested
in testing into a text string.

This is why it is called a printer: it "prints"
the object onto "paper" (text).

Instructions
------------
1. In vending_maching_gtest.cpp, make sure the
   test is running
2. Uncomment the Approval-line in end of test,
